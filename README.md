# Educational Institution Database System

## Problem Statement

This project is designed to manage and track students, professors, courses, enrollments, and research papers within an educational institution. The database captures relationships between students, the courses they take, the professors teaching those courses, and their research contributions. Operations such as inserting new records, updating existing data, deleting specific data, and querying insightful information are supported.
